Install `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` (the React Compiler ESLint plugin)\n2. Enable the recommended plugin rules: e.g. `reactHooksPlugin.configs.flat.recommended, jstsFiles`\n3. Run ESLint with `TIMING=50` on a large codebase (~15k+ files)\n4. Observe that `react-hooks/static-components` takes 42-56% of total lint time\n\n## Link to code example\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot share a minimal reproduction as this occurs on a large proprietary codebase. However, the performance data should be reproducible on any sufficiently large React codebase.\n\n## The current behavior\n\nWhen running ESLint with the `TIMING` flag on our codebase, the `react-hooks` plugin rules dominate lint time:\n\n```\nRule                                       |  Time (ms) | Relative\n:------------------------------------------|-----------:|--------:\nreact-hooks/static-components              | 393394.236 |    56.2%\nunused-imports/no-unused-imports           |  62579.162 |     8.9%\nredos-detector/no-unsafe-regex             |  35114.790 |     5.0%\nimport/named                               |  24641.617 |     3.5%\nreact-hooks/rules-of-hooks                 |  16596.903 |     2.4%\n...\n```\n\n**Key findings:**\n- `react-hooks/static-components` takes **~393 seconds** (6.5 minutes) — more than **5x longer** than the next slowest rule\n- The react-hooks plugin nearly **doubles total lint time**: ~3 minutes without the plugin vs ~6 minutes with it enabled\n- With 4x parallelism (`--concurrency=4`), total ESLint time goes from ~190 seconds to ~370 seconds when the plugin is enabled\n- Even if we disable `react-hooks/static-components`, another rule jumps up to take the top spot. It seems to trigger from the plugin itself, not any particular rule.\n\n## The expected behavior\n\nThe `react-hooks` rules should have comparable performance to other ESLint rules. A single rule taking 42-56% of total lint time and being 5x slower than any other rule suggests there may be optimization opportunities in the rule implementation.\n\n---\n\n**Impact:** This performance issue significantly affects CI pipeline times and local development experience. We're considering running these rules as a separate parallel step or disabling them entirely, which isn't ideal.",

The code defines a factory function createBindings() that returns React components. Inside the factory:\n    - InnerComponent is defined as a simple functional component\n    - OuterComponent uses InnerComponent inside a .map() callback\n  3. Observe the compiled output - the .map() callback is extracted to a module-scope function _temp:\n```ts\n  function _temp(item) {\n    console.log(\"InnerComponent:\", typeof InnerComponent);\n    return <InnerComponent key={item} value={item} />;\n  }\n```\n  4. _temp references InnerComponent, but InnerComponent is defined inside createBindings() - not at module scope.\n  The closure is broken.\n  5. At runtime, InnerComponent is undefined inside _temp, causing: Error: InnerComponent is not defined\n\n  Expected behavior:\n\n  The compiler should either:\n  - Keep the callback inline to preserve the closure\n  - Hoist captured variables along with the extracted function\n  - Skip compilation for callbacks that close over locally-scoped values\n\n  Workaround:\n\n  Adding 'use no memo' to OuterComponent prevents the callback extraction and preserves the closure.\n\n### How often does this bug happen?\n\nEvery time\n\n### What version of React are you using?\n\n19.2.0\n\n### What version of React Compiler are you using?\n\n1.0.0",

        "body": "## Summary\r\n\r\nSkill issue but I spent a significant amount of time today debugging something like `use(getPromise())` in a React component. React displayed this error, and ended up suspending again when state changed for the first time elsewhere in the component despite my `getPromise` function using a module level cache. I previously used `use` with Promises and this error message was useful, but I couldn't solve the issue for quite a while this time. My `getPromise` function looked something like this:\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\nconst bySlug = new Map<string, Promise<PostWithContent>>();\r\n\r\nexport async function getPostBySlug(slug: string): Promise<Post> {\r\n  const maybePromise = bySlug.get(slug);\r\n  if (maybePromise) {\r\n    return maybePromise;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  const loadPromise = (async () => {\r\n    const { default: content } = await import(\r\n      `../../posts/${slug}.mdx`\r\n    );\r\n    return content;\r\n  })();\r\n\r\n  bySlug.set(slug, loadPromise);\r\n\r\n  return loadPromise;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is a cache so it reuses the same promise each call. However, I eventually checked if `getPostBySlug(slug) === getPostBySlug(slug)`, noticed it was false, and realized that my component was marked as `async` despite not using async/await – likely from an earlier refactor. While the inner promise is cached, marking a function with `async` always returns a new Promise instance.\r\n\r\nI changed the error message to hint at this issue. I believe humans and AI will do a better job debugging issues with this hint.\r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\n\r\n`yarn test`",

The compiler-generated code (e.g., for memo cache sentinels) tries to call `Symbol.for()` but instead accesses the user's component, resulting in `\"Symbol.for is not a function\"`.\r\n\r\nPlayground repro: [Link](https://playground.react.dev/#N4Igzg9grgTgxgUxALhAejQAgMIwQQwBcFN9M4IBbABwgDsE7DM79KEATTAZQE9KARhAA2AHToAzKHTiEAlvR78hwgBQBKTMHGZMeQrDqYAPBzkA3AHwBJUpVJLBI8lVoMmxtGasBucQF9xcQxMAFUwEjlmOSMAQWpqcQQAD1oYZg4ECXwoYWYpGXlFeOoNLR09BAMYI1UK3VMLS3rdEwALAEZLACUCWRxXOWEEGEwAISgAc0xe6hgIDihZBTpPTuajVoa+J2FMNA2tz29DzHU-On8QABoQCkk5SZQQORoIdMxCXmoSYEwABWEUxiAHlqEU6GBMP5MBJ5vYAOQCfACBDCAC01CBkxi6Lw+Fk6IoNCGIy8cjAhARF3Eqm0mwwxOoQyIKwAsgsEMhMKIQPhhGIQAFMGBWWAJHIEFDAcC6GCIWBzjdwG0IAB3axMEasYRgFDZXUIfxAA)\r\n\r\n**The Fix:**\r\nUpdated [CodegenReactiveFunction.ts](cci:7://file:///Users/gowtham/Downloads/react-main/compiler/packages/babel-plugin-react-compiler/src/ReactiveScopes/CodegenReactiveFunction.ts:0:0-0:0) to use `globalThis.Symbol.for()` instead of bare `Symbol.for()` references. This ensures the built-in global is always used, regardless of local variable names.\r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\n\r\n1. **Added a new test fixture** ([component-named-symbol-shadows-global.js](cci:7://file:///Users/gowtham/Downloads/react-main/compiler/packages/babel-plugin-react-compiler/src/__tests__/fixtures/compiler/component-named-symbol-shadows-global.js:0:0-0:0)) that defines a component named [Symbol](cci:1://file:///Users/gowtham/Downloads/react-main/compiler/packages/babel-plugin-react-compiler/src/__tests__/fixtures/compiler/component-named-symbol-shadows-global.js:2:0-4:1).\r\n   - Verified that this test case previously failed (or would produce broken code) and now compiles to correct code using `globalThis.Symbol`.\r\n2. **Verified generated output:** checked that the compiled output for cache sentinels and early return sentinels now explicitly uses `globalThis.Symbol`.\r\n3. **Manual verification:** Confirmed the fix addresses the issue reported in the playground.",

Configure a React app to run React Compiler.\n2. Create a component named `Symbol`.\n3. Run the app.\n\nThe issue relates to the fact that React Compiler generates output with a call to `Symbol.for`. As shown in the playground link, if a component is in scope with the name `Symbol`, the compiler-generated code tries to call the `for` method on the React component rather than `globalThis.Symbol`. This results in the runtime error \"Symbol.for is not a function\".\n\n### How often does this bug happen?\n\nEvery time\n\n### What version of React are you using?\n\n19.2.3\n\n### What version of React Compiler are you using?\n\n1.0.0",

Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request. The three fields below are mandatory.\r\n\r\n  Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:\r\n\r\n  1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create your branch from `main`.\r\n  2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.\r\n  3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n  4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.\r\n  5. Run `yarn test --prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.\r\n  6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn test --debug --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\r\n  7. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\r\n  8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only check changed files.\r\n  9. Run the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) type checks (`yarn flow`).\r\n  10. If you haven't already, complete the CLA.\r\n\r\n  Learn more about contributing: https://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Explain the **motivation** for making this change. What existing problem does the pull request solve?\r\n-->\r\nHoist the key escaping helpers used by `React.Children` to module scope so they’re reused across calls instead of re-created on every invocation. This is a behavior-preserving change that reduces allocations/GC overhead in a frequently executed path when mapping large child lists.\r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Demonstrate the code is solid. Example: The exact commands you ran and their output, screenshots / videos if the pull request changes the user interface.\r\n  How exactly did you verify that your PR solves the issue you wanted to solve?\r\n  If you leave this empty, your PR will very likely be closed.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- `yarn test ReactChildren-test --runInBand`\r\n- `yarn test --prod ReactChildren-test --runInBand`\r\n\r\nAll existing tests pass. No behavior changes expected.",

Please test using the latest version of the relevant\n  React packages to make sure your issue has not already been fixed.\n-->\n\nWhen calling `setState` from inside `React.useEffect`, as opposed to directly `useEffect`, the `set-state-in-effect` eslint rule does not detect a violation. This rule should detect violations regardless of how `useState` and `useEffect` are imported.\n\nReact version: 19.2.3\n`eslint-plugin-react-hooks` version: 7.0.1\n\n## Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Enable `set-state-in-effect` in your eslint config\n2. Import React with `import * as React from 'react'`\n3. Create a component that calls `setState` from inside `React.useEffect`\n4. Run eslint and observe that eslint does not fail\n<!--\n  Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't\n  have dependencies other than React.

The workflows should be tested by running them on a branch before merging.\n",

I've also spin up [this benchmark](https://gist.github.com/romgrk/3c64ac061e2267d65db22703d32a5abf) that puts an extreme focus on effects to illustrate clearly the improvement. The average runtime is consistently lower, but interestingly the standard deviation is also consistently lower, which probably indicates that the garbage collector is doing less pauses (due to the fewer memory allocations).\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n<img width=\"877\" height=\"121\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f1cf943-01e9-43eb-b6a2-a39cc4fffab4\" />\r\nAfter:\r\n<img width=\"877\" height=\"121\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/469bbd68-a72f-44a4-9bd7-d866d54cbd57\" />\r\n\r\n",

This breaks the expected behavior where controlled inputs should maintain their state.\r\n\r\n**Affected input types:**\r\n- Text inputs (`<input type=\"text\">`)\r\n- Select elements (`<select>`)\r\n- Textareas (`<textarea>`)\r\n- Checkboxes (`<input type=\"checkbox\">`)\r\n- Radio buttons (`<input type=\"radio\">`)\r\n\r\n## The Fix\r\nEnhanced `resetFormInstance()` in `ReactFiberConfigDOM.js` to:\r\n1. Check React's internal fiber tree to determine if an input is controlled\r\n2. Examine `memoizedProps` for control props:\r\n   - `value` prop for text inputs, select elements, and textareas\r\n   - `checked` prop for checkboxes and radio buttons\r\n3. Skip reset for controlled inputs\r\n4. Only reset truly uncontrolled inputs\r\n\r\nThis ensures controlled inputs maintain their state after form submission while uncontrolled inputs still reset as expected.\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\nAdded comprehensive test coverage in `ReactDOMForm-test.js`:\r\n\r\n**Controlled inputs (should NOT reset):**\r\n- Controlled checkboxes don't reset on form submission\r\n- Controlled radio buttons don't reset on form submission\r\n- Controlled select elements don't reset on form submission\r\n- Controlled textarea elements don't reset on form submission\r\n\r\n**Uncontrolled inputs (should still reset):**\r\n- Uncontrolled checkboxes still reset correctly\r\n- Uncontrolled select elements still reset correctly\r\n- Uncontrolled textarea elements still reset correctly\r\n\r\nAll existing tests continue to pass\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n- Ran full test suite: `yarn test ReactDOMForm-test`\r\n- Verified reproduction case scenarios\r\n- Tested with both controlled and uncontrolled inputs across all affected input types",

Write a render prop function which happens to contain nested functions with component-like names\n2. Enable react compiler\n3.

The original setStore variable inside the closure is renamed to setStore2\n  2. The hoisted _temp function still references setStore (the original name)\n  3. Since _temp is outside the closure, it cannot access setStore2\n  4. This results in ReferenceError: setStore is not defined at runtime\n\n  This error occurs in both local development and production builds.\n\n  Environment\n\n  - vite: 7.2.2\n  - react: 19.2.0\n  - react-dom: 19.2.0\n  - babel-plugin-react-compiler: 1.0.0\n\n### How often does this bug happen?\n\nEvery time\n\n### What version of React are you using?\n\n19.2.0\n\n### What version of React Compiler are you using?\n\n19.2.0",

Please test using the latest version of the relevant\n  React packages to make sure your issue has not already been fixed.\n-->\nSuspense fallback is not rendered during SSR when the root component lacks top-level `<html>`, `<head>`, or `<body>` tags. The server buffers the entire response until all suspended promises resolve, preventing streaming and the rendering of the initial fallback content.\n\nThis behavior impacts a use case where the React component is rendered as a sub-tree to be integrated into a larger application that uses a different framework.\n\nThis [commit](https://github.com/facebook/react/commit/b25bcd460f98a0b89e5a7199a6c88112163d961f) introduced this behavior change in the streaming logic where it worked in 19.0.0.\n\nReact version: 19.1-19.2\n\n## Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Access https://3c4mqn-8080.csb.app/no-streaming\n\n<!--\n  Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't\n  have dependencies other than React. Issues without reproduction steps or\n  code examples may be immediately closed as not actionable.\n-->\n\n<!--\n  Please provide a CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new), a link to a\n  repository on GitHub, or provide a minimal code example that reproduces the\n  problem. You may provide a screenshot of the application if you think it is\n  relevant to your bug report. Here are some tips for providing a minimal\n  example: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve.\n-->\n\n## The current behavior\n\nThe server renders the component's final output without showing the fallback. The generated HTML for the suspended component only contains the resolved content wrapped in the standard suspense boundary markers:\n\n```html\n<!--$--><h1>Hello</h1><!--/$-->\n```\n\nNo fallback content (i.e., the \"Loading...\" message) is rendered to the client.\n\n## The expected behavior\n\nThe`Loading...` fallback should be rendered, mirroring the correct behavior observed in the full-document rendering path:\n\n```html\n<!--$-->\n<!--$?-->\n<template id=\"B:0\"></template>\nLoading...\n<!--/$-->\n<!--/$-->\n<script id=\"_R_\">\n  ...\n</script>\n<div hidden id=\"S:0\">\n  <h1>Hello</h1>\n</div>\n<script>\n  ...\n</script>\n```\nComparison Path: https://3c4mqn-8080.csb.app/\n",

For example:\n\n```jsx\nexport default function Component({ foo, bar }) {\n\tif (!foo && !bar) {\n\t\tfoo = \"foo\";\n\t}\n\n\treturn (\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t{Array.from({ length: 3 }, (_, i) => <div key={i}>{foo}</div>)}\n\t\t</div>\n\t);\n}\n```\n\nI got this error:\n> Todo: Support destructuring of context variables\n\nYou can also replace the if statement `if (!foo && !bar) { foo = \"foo\"; }` with the content itself `foo = \"foo\";`, that will also trigger the issue, however it is meaningless.\n\nThe modified prop must in a callback, directly use it will work fine. For example, `<div>{foo}</div>` works fine, and `<div>{(() => foo)()}</div>` raise an issue.\n\nI think the code above should be automatically converted into the code below which can work properly. Although I can also use the code below directly, it will only cause more trouble.\n\n```jsx\nexport default function Component({ foo: _foo, bar }) {\n\tlet foo = _foo;\n\tif (!foo && !bar) {\n\t\tfoo = \"foo\";\n\t}\n\n\treturn (\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t{Array.from({ length: 3 }, (_, i) => <div key={i}>{foo}</div>)}\n\t\t</div>\n\t);\n}\n```\n\n### How often does this bug happen?\n\nEvery time\n\n### What version of React are you using?\n\n19.2.1\n\n### What version of React Compiler are you using?\n\n1.0.0",

        "body": "\nWe currently model impure functions like `Date.now()` with an `Impure` effect, but the way this works is that the effect is considered an error if it's called at all. But we really want to reflect the fact that the _value_ is impure, and is okay to be used outside of render. For example, `useRef(Date.now())` should be fine.\n\nSo this PR changes the Impure effect to describe that an impure value flows `into: Place`. We flow impurity through the data flow graph during InferMutationAliasingRanges, including propagating this to the function's effects. So if a function expression returns a transitively impure value, that's expressed in our inferred signature for that function. Calling it propagates the impurity via our effect system.\n\nWe stop this propagation when reaching a ref, allowing `useRef(Date.now())` or `useRef(localFunctionThatReturnsDateNow())`.\n\nThis lets us also model accessing a ref as an impure value - we just emit an `Impure` event for PropertyLoad/ComputedLoad off of a ref, and the above tracking kicks in.\n\nA final piece is that we can also use our existing machinery to disallow writing to global values during render to handle writing to refs - except that we need to allow the lazy init pattern. So it probably makes sense to keep the ref validation pass, but scope it back to just handling writes and not reads.\n\nThis definitely needs more polish, the error messages would ideally be something like:\n\n```\nError: cannot call impure function in render\n\nBlah blah description of why this is bad...\n\nfoo.js:0:0\n  <Foo x={x} />\n          ^ This value reads from an impure function\n\nfoo.js:0:0\n  x = Date.now();\n      ^^^^^^^^ The value derives from Date.now which is impure\n```\n\nIe show you both the local site (where impurity flows into render) and the ultiamte source of the impure value.\n",

The `applyConstantPropagation` function is updated to utilize these identifiers, improving the handling of local JSX tags during constant evaluation. Additionally, test fixtures are adjusted to reflect changes in JSX tag evaluation order and local tag usage.\r\n\r\n- Fix React Compiler constant propagation so it no longer replaces JSX tag aliases with their constant values. The compiler now tracks identifiers that appear in JSX tag position and skips propagating through their defining loads, ensuring <Comp /> stays an identifier instead of turning into `<base />`.\r\n- Add a regression fixture (repro-jsx-dynamic-tag-alias) that mirrors the reported repro to prevent regressions.",

The expected behavior screenshot shows when my repo had eslint-plugin-react-compiler@beta and eslint-plugin-react-hooks@4.6.2 installed. [Per the React Compiler v1.0 announcement](https://react.dev/blog/2025/10/07/react-compiler-1#migrating-from-eslint-plugin-react-compiler-to-eslint-plugin-react-hooks), I removed eslint-plugin-react-compiler, bumped eslint-plugin-react-hooks to the latest version (7.0.1), and made the eslint config changes accordingly. All other rules, including the new ones, seem to work as expected, except this one seems to have disappeared (I only noticed because our codebase has many instances of this that we've been planning to fix at some point before enabling the compiler). Is this a bug or is this no longer meant to throw a lint error, since it does [explicitly break the rules of React](https://react.dev/reference/rules/react-calls-components-and-hooks#never-pass-around-hooks-as-regular-values) ? \n\n## The current behavior\n<img width=\"898\" height=\"317\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90110fe0-a571-4aee-b863-4e7968dc9b1b\" />\n\n## The expected behavior\n<img width=\"898\" height=\"317\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ca533cf-44ce-42d5-a8b1-25760123173b\" />",

Since `React` is not an effect hook, the validation was skipped.\r\n\r\nThe fix changes `instr.value.receiver` to `instr.value.property` so that `useEffect` is correctly identified as an effect hook.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n const callee =\r\n   instr.value.kind === 'MethodCall'\r\n-    ? instr.value.receiver\r\n+    ? instr.value.property\r\n     : instr.value.callee;\r\n```\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Added a `React.useEffect` case to `invalid-setState-in-useEffect.js`.\r\n2. Updated `invalid-setState-in-useEffect.expect.md` and checked the Logs: only one `CompileError` at line 7, missing `React.useEffect` at line 10.

Updated `invalid-setState-in-useEffect.expect.md` again and checked the Logs: now two `CompileError`s are reported (line 7 and line 10).

The previous implementation relied on implicit assumptions about node validity, list integrity, and scheduler availability. This updated version strengthens those areas and introduces a more explicit and robust API.\r\n\r\n## Key Improvements\r\n\r\n- Stricter Flow types for Entry and the public LRU interface.\r\n- Stronger doubly-linked-list invariants with defensive guards against corrupted or deleted entries.\r\n- Safe fallback scheduling when React Scheduler is unavailable.\r\n- More reliable cleanup behavior, ensuring that onDelete errors do not interrupt eviction.\r\n- Explicit and expanded APIs, including:\r\n  - add\r\n  - access\r\n  - update\r\n  - remove\r\n  - setLimit\r\n  - dump\r\n  - getSize\r\n  - getLimit\r\n- Immediate cleanup scheduling within add() to prevent uncontrolled memory growth.\r\n- Frozen public API object to avoid accidental mutation.\r\n- Improved GC friendliness by fully detaching deleted nodes.\r\n- Enhanced debugging utilities through dump() and size helpers.\r\n\r\n## Why this change?\r\n- While functional, the earlier implementation had several limitations:\r\n- Accessing or updating deleted entries could happen silently.\r\n- Corrupted circular list states were not detected.\r\n- Errors thrown inside onDelete could interrupt eviction.\r\n- No direct method existed to remove an entry explicitly.\r\n- Lack of scheduler fallback.\r\n- Debugging and inspecting internal cache state was difficult.\r\nThis rewrite improves the resilience of the LRU cache and ensures predictable cleanup behavior even in error scenarios.\r\n\r\n##How did you test this change?\r\n- Manually tested list behavior including add, access, update, and remove.\r\n- Verified correct eviction ordering by exceeding cache limits.\r\n- Simulated both presence and absence of the React Scheduler to confirm fallback logic.\r\n- Ensured errors thrown inside onDelete do not break cleanup.\r\n- Verified deleted entries cannot be accessed or updated.\r\n\r\nRan the full test suite:\r\n`yarn test`\r\n`yarn test --prod`\r\n\r\nVerified Flow type checks:\r\n`yarn flow`\r\n\r\nVerified formatting and linting:\r\n`yarn prettier`\r\n`yarn lint / yarn linc`",

This caused false positives for regular classes that don't extend React.Component.\r\n\r\n**Example of false positive:**\r\n```javascript\r\nclass Store {\r\n  use() {\r\n    return React.useState(4); // Was incorrectly flagged as error\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nAdded a helper function `isReactComponentClass()` that checks if a class actually extends `React.Component` or `React.PureComponent` before reporting an error. Regular classes (without extends or extending other classes) can now use hooks in their methods without triggering false positives.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n- Added `isReactComponentClass()` helper function in `RulesOfHooks.ts`\r\n- Updated the class method check to only flag hooks in actual React component classes\r\n- Added test cases for both valid (regular classes) and invalid (React component classes) scenarios\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Added test case for regular class with hooks (should be valid)\r\n- Added test cases for React component classes with hooks (should be invalid)\r\n- Existing tests continue to passThe ESLint rule 'react-hooks/rules-of-hooks' was incorrectly flagging hooks used in regular class methods as invalid, assuming all classes are React components.\r\n\r\nThis fix adds a helper function isReactComponentClass() that checks if a class actually extends React.Component or React.PureComponent before reporting an error. Regular classes (without extends) can now use hooks in their methods without triggering false positives.\r\n\r\nFixes #35264\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Thanks for submitting a pull request!\r\n  We appreciate you spending the time to work on these changes.

        "body": "The `visitAsyncNode` function used `null` as both an \"in progress\" marker and a valid cached result. When a node was revisited during its own traversal (circular reference), the function returned `null` as if it were a cached result, which could lead to infinite recursion.\r\n\r\nThis bug was introduced in #35005 when `visited` was changed from a `Set` to a `Map` for caching return values.\r\n\r\nThis change:\r\n- Introduces an `IN_PROGRESS` sentinel Symbol to distinguish nodes currently being evaluated from cached results\r\n- Returns `null` on cycle detection to indicate \"no I/O found on this cyclic path\" (not `undefined`, which would signal abort semantics and skip emitting I/O info for other non-cyclic branches)\r\n- Always caches the computed result after `visitAsyncNodeImpl` returns, including `null`/`undefined` values, so revisits get the real computed value instead of the sentinel\r\n\r\nThis fixes `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded` that occurs in Next.js 15.5.0+ when using database clients like Gel/EdgeDB that create circular promise chains in their async sequences.\r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\n\r\nValidated manually in Next.js apps (15.5, 16.0.5, 16.1.0-canary) using the Gel/EdgeDB repro that previously hit the stack overflow. No React unit test added; the internal module system made mocking `getAsyncSequenceFromPromise` impractical from the test suite. Fix verified via integration runs only.\r\n\r\n## Reproduction Repository\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jere-co/next-debug\r\n\r\nThis repository contains:\r\n- A minimal reproduction case triggering the bug\r\n- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce and verify the fix\r\n- Root cause analysis in `/docs`\r\n- A temporary patch script for affected projects",

        "body": "### Website or app\n\nhttps://github.com/mukesharyal/react-devtools-bug-report\n\n### Repro steps\n\n1. Clone the GitHub repo and run `npm install`\n2. Run the local dev server with `npm run dev` and also run React Devtools\n3. You will see two components `ComponentA` and `ComponentB`\n4. Cause a re-render of `ComponentA` by clicking the button a bunch of times\n5. `ComponentB` will also be shown in the component render highlights and `Profiler` sessions\n\nThe structure of `App` component looks like this:\n\n```\nimport ComponentA from './components/ComponentA';\nimport ComponentB from './components/ComponentB';\n\nfunction App() {\n\n\treturn(\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<ComponentA />\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<ComponentB />\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t);\n\n}\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\nThis is what `ComponentA` looks like:\n\n```\nimport { useState } from \"react\";\n\nexport default function ComponentA()\n{\n    console.log(\"Component A rendered!\");\n\n    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n    return(\n        \n        <>\n            <h1>\n                Component A\n            </h1>\n               \n            <h2>\n                Count is {count}\n            </h2>\n\n            <button onClick={() => { setCount(count => count + 1) }}>\n                Increase Count\n            </button>\n        </>\n    )\n}\n```\n\nAnd here is `ComponentB`:\n\n```\nexport default function ComponentB()\n{\n    console.log(\"Component B rendered!\");\n\n    return(\n        <>\n            <h1>\n                Component B\n            </h1>\n        </>\n    )\n}\n```\n\nNow, when I re-render `ComponentA` by clicking the button a bunch of times, I see re-render highlights in `ComponentA`. But, the surprising part is that I also see highlights in `ComponentB`.\n\nHere are the highlights:\n\n<img width=\"597\" height=\"297\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/806fdfe3-7132-481c-a664-31302019ef2f\" />\n\nAnd here is a `Profiler` session I recorded:\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"406\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed397760-ad82-407f-aa25-acf6d9699489\" />\n\nIt clearly shwos that `ComponentB` also \"re-rendered\" a bunch of times, and it actually took **more time** to \"re-render\" `ComponentB` than `ComponentA`.\n\nAnd here is what the console logs look like:\n\n<img width=\"1109\" height=\"843\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d71a14be-6288-4004-9d88-3033d6f021c1\" />\n\nAnd indeed, like we expect, there is only the console log when `ComponentB` rendered the first time and not again. But, the `Profiler` session and the component render highlights say otherwise.\n\nNow, let's change the structure of `App` component just a little bit:\n\n```\nimport ComponentA from './components/ComponentA';\nimport ComponentB from './components/ComponentB';\n\nfunction App() {\n\n\treturn(\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<ComponentA />\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<ComponentB />\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t);\n\n}\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\nAnd now let's see the component highlights and `Profiler` session.\n\nHere is the highlights now:\n\n<img width=\"600\" height=\"563\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33a33dfe-8e73-4c0b-8521-b4ef1e6b2a96\" />\n\nAnd here is what the `Profiler` says:\n\n<img width=\"1018\" height=\"300\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51236cf3-f29e-4fd9-bfe7-4b3cb497e288\" />\n\nSo, now the results are what we expect.\n\nThis project was made with `React 19`, but we also see the same things with `React 18` as well. And, the presence or absence of the `React Compiler` makes no difference.\n\nTo verify that the effects are not seen with composition, I made a simple `Wrapper` component and had the same `div`s wrap our components as before. Here is the `Wrapper`:\n\n```\nexport default function Wrapper({ children })\n{\n    return(\n        <div>\n            { children }\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n```\n\nAnd now, we use the `Wrapper` instead of `div`s in our `App` component like this:\n\n```\nimport Wrapper from './components/Wrapper';\n\nimport ComponentA from './components/ComponentA';\nimport ComponentB from './components/ComponentB';\n\nfunction App() {\n\n\treturn(\n\n\t\t<Wrapper>\n\n\t\t\t<Wrapper>\n\t\t\t\t<ComponentA />\n\t\t\t</Wrapper>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t<Wrapper>\n\t\t\t\t<ComponentB />\n\t\t\t</Wrapper>\n\n\t\t</Wrapper>\n\t);\n\n}\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\nThankfully, we do not see the weird behavior in this case. Sigh!\n\nSo after all this, we clearly see that the weird stuffs are only seen in a specific case where we are using `div`s before the composition for layout purposes.\n\nBut, I do think that this is not at all \"expected React behavior\". Either this is a bug with the React library itself, or the React Devtools are lying to us.\n\nSo, that was the weird thing I saw. I have also written a blog post where I discuss this same thing in more detail. It can be found [here](https://www.mukesharyal.com.np/blog/on-react-reconciliation/).\n\n### How often does this bug happen?\n\nEvery time\n\n### DevTools package (automated)\n\n_No response_\n\n### DevTools version (automated)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Error message (automated)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Error call stack (automated)\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Error component stack (automated)\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### GitHub query string (automated)\n\n```text\n\n```",

An \"implicit undefined\" initial state is perfectly fine and saves people from typing 6 characters each time.\n\nWhen I omit the second argument, React appears to be working just fine.

There's no fallback\r\n    So far no fallback was good enough for the Components and Suspense tab because you couldn't  escape React Elements in those tabs. In the browsers Elements panel it's much easier to do so a fallback is warranted. Probably fine to add the fallback in every context.\r\n3. If you're filtering DOM elements (default), you might be confused ho clicking a DOM element does not inspect the React element but a parent. That's especially confusing when you click different DOM elements with the same parent and the inspected element doesn't change.\r\n    I don't have a solution for that yet. Maybe that's fine in the end and it's something you get used to. The main problem right now is that initial load ignores the users setting and hides host Elements by default. Fixing that particular bug might help this issue the most.\r\n\r\nI'll file 1 and 2 as immediate follow-ups.\r\n\r\nOther follow-ups:\r\n1. We should be updating the inspected element when the filter changes while in the React Element pane. Right now you have to click back and forth to inspect the element according to the new filter.",

I create a component with 2 states that won't interact, and array and a counter ([React Compiler Playground Link](https://playground.react.dev/#N4Igzg9grgTgxgUxALhAgHgBwjALgAgBMEAzAQygBsCSoA7OXASwjvwFkBPAQU0wAoAlPmAAdNvjiswBANpT6uADT4wCXAGFodXAF18AXnxQ1AZVxlcCfgAZBAbnH5J0uUysBbMCrW4Akp5g+kYmCOaW1rIAjCoATCoAzCoALCoArLqC4k4udDL4JEzUCDAIhAEIXob47pVgAHSFxTD8AG6GAHz4rQCksYYGRnbZElJ5BEwMpR4IOtVCnSI5zr5aim2LrQDUUVkSAL4jzmP5ZITlnvPCBl1iEivqFV4bN-iy9R+tKq31lLMA5rgABb4Lb4KKZHKHOhHfClXCwNgAHkITFaHWW+CRmA6Wg8mCssBECh0+yRAHocZikQAjKC4XCsfCsDSUJhwADWBmAkzg01muH2HT8UwAlzMdCUKXSGawMfcsVR5c4VSImlZShc6vUPGQBLUPIskWz8ByEJxuQahTzPGTyWyOoJoarnLT6Yy2Cy2ZzuWctR4hdxzvgntL3XLqeSlTkKaj0eJoSAlCAxoV-igQEx8TgCLhOJgECJ8AAFShQf6TADyBJYeXw+wKMAghoA5DSyDSEJQALSYMsVujd0pkRjdqT4oolcmomQtxwwuj8O7Ocnk8eYIqWWvsCDEZD4UQgMiUSiHhOqLdgQoIMAl-tVmvSBxJ8BAiAAdxFGrox7AKHIlBqPsQA))\n\n```tsx\nexport default function MyApp() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  const [items, setItems] = useState([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n\n  const filteredItems = items.filter(v => v%2 === 0)\n\n  const increment = () => {\n    setCount(v => v+1)\n  }\n\n  const addItem = () => {\n    setItems(v => [...v, v.length + 1])\n  }\n\n\n  return <div>\n    <p>Compteur {count}</p>\n    <button onClick={increment}>Incrémenter</button>\n    <ul>\n      {filteredItems.map(item => <li key={item}>{item}</li>)}\n      <button onClick={addItem}>Add Item</button>\n    </ul>\n  </div>\n}\n```\n\n2. I would expect `filteredItem` to be memoised with \"items\" as a dependency. But it produce this code\n\n```jsx\n// Compiler output\n  if ($[1] !== count || $[2] !== items) {\n    const filteredItems = items.filter(_temp);\n    let t5;\n    if ($[7] === Symbol.for(\"react.memo_cache_sentinel\")) {\n      t5 = () => {\n        setCount(_temp2);\n      };\n      $[7] = t5;\n    } else {\n      t5 = $[7];\n    }\n\nlet t2\n// Expected output\n  if ($[1] !== items) {\n    t2 = items.filter(_temp);\n    $[1] = items\n    $[2] = filteredItems\n    } else {\n      t2= $[2];\n    }\n```\n\n## The current behavior\n\nIt groups everything after the filteredItems inside a condition\n\n\n## The expected behavior\n\n- `filteredItems` should be memoised\n- The 3 children of the virtual dom should be in their own condition with the right dependency\n",

Wrap a lazy-loaded component inside <Suspense fallback={<Spinner />}>.\n2. Simulate a slow network response (2–5 seconds delay).\n3.

This leads to stale subscriptions and\nunexpected behavior in components that rely on cleanup.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Create a component with a useEffect that logs cleanup.\n2. Trigger state updates inside a loop or with very small intervals (5–10ms).\n3. Observe that cleanup logs are skipped or delayed.\n\n### Expected Behavior\nCleanup should run reliably before every re-invocation of the effect, regardless of\nhow fast state is updated.\n\n### Actual Behavior\nCleanup is inconsistently triggered during extremely fast re-renders.\n\n### Version\n- React: Latest main branch\n- Environment: Browser (Chrome/Edge)\n- OS: Windows 10 / macOS (tested both)\n\n### Additional Info\nIssue seems more noticeable in strict mode, possibly due to double rendering behavior.\n",

DevTools UI stops responding until switching to another tab or selecting a different component.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Create a component that re-renders frequently (e.g., using setInterval or a high-frequency animation state update).\n2. Open React DevTools → Components tab.\n3. Select the rapidly updating component.\n4. Observe props/state panel becoming unresponsive or delayed.\n\n### Expected Behavior\nDevTools should continue updating props/state smoothly without UI freeze.\n\n### Actual Behavior\nProps/state panel becomes unresponsive; UI stops updating and interaction freezes temporarily.\n\n### Environment\n- React DevTools version: (latest stable, please fill exact version)\n- Browser: Chrome/Firefox (tested on Chrome)\n- OS: Windows/Linux/macOS (repro across machines)\n\n### Additional Details\n- Switching to Profiler tab and back sometimes restores responsiveness.\n- Suspect bottleneck during frequent renders or serialization.\n- Can provide minimal reproduction repo if required.\n",

        "body": "I’m seeing a behavioral change in Suspense + React.lazy rendering order when upgrading from React 18.3.1 to React 19.x.\nSpecifically:\n\nReact 18.3.1: Components render once, in order:\nCompA → CompB → CompC → CompD\n\nReact 19.1.0: Still renders cleanly in order (same as 18.3.1).\n\nReact 19.2.0: Rendering order changes significantly, and components render multiple times in progressive batches, producing logs like:\n```\nCompA\nCompB\nCompA\nCompB\nCompC\nCompA\nCompB\nCompC\nCompD\n```\nThis occurs even in production build, and without StrictMode.\nSplitting each component into its own Suspense boundary restores the expected behavior.\n\nThis appears to be caused by a change in Suspense reveal / pre-warm scheduling between 19.1 and 19.2 — but I'm not sure if this is an intended change, an edge case, or a regression.\n\nI'm opening this issue to confirm:\n- Is this new repeated rendering behavior expected in 19.2?\n- Is there documentation on the Suspense behavior change between 19.1 and 19.2?\n- Should a single Suspense boundary cause repeated re-renders for sibling lazy components in this minimal case?\n\n## Minimal Reproduction\nReproduction environment\nReact versions tested:\n18.3.1\n19.1.0\n19.2.0\nBuild: Production build \nMode: No StrictMode\nBundler: any (Vite/Webpack tested) — same results\nBrowser: Chrome stable\n\n## Code Example (minimal)\n\nApp.tsx\n```\nimport { lazy, Suspense } from \"react\";\n\nconst CompA = lazy(() => import(\"./CompA\"));\nconst CompB = lazy(() => import(\"./CompB\"));\nconst CompC = lazy(() => import(\"./CompC\"));\nconst CompD = lazy(() => import(\"./CompD\"));\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Suspense fallback={null}>\n        <CompA />\n        <CompB />\n        <CompC />\n        <CompD />\n      </Suspense>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n```\n\nCompA.tsx (same for B/C/D)\n\n```\nconst CompA = () => {\n  console.log(\"CompA\");\n  return <div>CompA</div>;\n};\n\nexport default CompA;\n\n```\n\n## Output logs\nReact 18.3.1\n```\nCompA\nCompB\nCompC\nCompD\n```\n\nReact 19.1.0\n```\nCompA\nCompB\nCompC\nCompD\n```\n\nReact 19.2.0\n```\nCompA\nCompB\nCompA\nCompB\nCompC\nCompA\nCompB\nCompC\nCompD\n```\n## Additional Observation\nIf I change the code to one Suspense per component:\n```\n<div>\n  <Suspense fallback={null}><CompA /></Suspense>\n  <Suspense fallback={null}><CompB /></Suspense>\n  <Suspense fallback={null}><CompC /></Suspense>\n  <Suspense fallback={null}><CompD /></Suspense>\n</div>\n```\nThen React 19.2 logs return to normal:\n```\nCompA\nCompB\nCompC\nCompD\n```\nThis strongly suggests the repeated-render behavior is tied to shared sibling Suspense trees.\n\n# Questions for the React team\n\n- Is the repeated, interleaved rendering behavior in React 19.2 an intentional Suspense change?\n- Is this part of the new \"pre-warm / batched reveals\" behavior introduced in React 19?\n- Should this happen even in a minimal tree where each component only does a static lazy import?\n- Is this considered a regression, or should apps rely on separate Suspense boundaries to avoid this?\n",

Use Mantine's library (maybe other UI libraries has the same problem, no idea)\n2. Use \"Box\" and \"Paper\" components (you can try other ones too)\n3. Navigate between pages and you will get randomly this error\n\nLink to reproduce the problem: https://www.ndnci.com/tools/\n\n## Steps To Reproduce in the demo\n\n1. Go to \"Tools\" listing page\n2. Click on any tool, then in the breadcrumbs, click back on \"Tools\" and repeat the same thing on several tools, I don't know how many click we need to get this but when it happens it is very anoying because the UI is completely broken, we have to reload the page\n\n## The current behavior\n\nHydratation issue brokes the UI during navigation randomly\n\n<img width=\"1858\" height=\"728\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c678333-db3b-450d-bffd-daa39aca070c\" />\n\n## The expected behavior\n\nHydratation issue must be fixed and never break the UI\n\n<img width=\"1549\" height=\"680\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22d864ed-7d2e-47aa-a24e-86a5421206fa\" />\n",

To handle this, I implemented a fallback mechanism that, if eval fails, attempts to evaluate the code in a Content Script.\r\n\r\nBecause Content Scripts do not have access to the `Developer Tools Console API` (e.g., inspect(), $0), some features (e.g. focusing a specified DOM node in the Elements panel) will remain unavailable.  \r\nHowever, this change still improves a situation where developer tools were completely unusable and will make many features available.\r\n\r\n## How to test\r\n\r\nPlease follow the reproduction steps from the original issue (#34268) to test behavior.  \r\n\r\nNote: when you reload the extension, tabs that were already open may not behave correctly. After loading the extension, open a new tab to test.\r\n\r\n## Detailed flow of operations\r\n\r\n```mermaid\r\nsequenceDiagram\r\n    participant DevTools as DevTools Page<br>(main/index.js)\r\n    participant Background as Background Script<br>(background/messageHandlers.js)\r\n    participant CS as Content Script<br>[ExecutionWorld.ISOLATE]<br>(contentScripts/proxy.js)\r\n    participant Page as Content Script<br>[ExecutionWorld.MAIN]<br>(contentScripts/fallbackEvalContext.js)\r\n    \r\n    alt First, attempt the regular processing\r\n        DevTools->>DevTools: chrome.devtools.inspectedWindow.eval()\r\n    else If it fails due to an error, run the fallback process below.

Check out the reproduction repository\n2. Run `npm run dev`, or `npm run build && npm run start` as the problem exists in both dev mode and production\n3. See the index field of each item in the next list is off by one. Every item in the list should have a sequential \"Count\" value starting at 1, not\n\n#### Details in the Reproduction Code\nThe code in `src/app/page.tsx` uses Array.reduce to build an array of nodes, and keeps track of a counter in the aggregated value. \n\nWhen we use this code:\n```ts\nconst count = agg.itemCounter++;\n```\nThe compiled output translates to:\n```ts\nagg.itemCounter = agg.itemCounter + 1;\nconst count = agg.itemCounter;\n```\nWhich is not equivalent because it increments before assigning, rather than assigning and then incrementing.\n\nThe issue goes away by taking the counter out of the aggregate object and into a normal variable outside of the reduce function. \n\n#### Conclusion\nI realize that this way of keeping the count in the aggregated value is not the best way, but this is not strictly against the \"Rules of React\". If it is, it should probably be added to the ESLint rules. \n\nThis issue was found on a large codebase that was working just fine before enabling the compiler. And we had no indication that this code would not work after enabling the compiler.\n\n### How often does this bug happen?\n\nEvery time\n\n### What version of React are you using?\n\n19.2.0\n\n### What version of React Compiler are you using?\n\n1.0.0",

This fixes the regression in React 19.x where returning `null` from `useEffect` causes `TypeError: destroy is not a function` during cleanup.\r\n\r\nCurrently, React only validates cleanup return values in DEV mode during effect mount, but doesn't check before calling cleanup during unmount in production.\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\n\r\nWhen a non-function value (like `null`) is stored in `inst.destroy`, React attempts to call it during unmount, causing `TypeError: destroy is not a function` crashes in production.\r\n\r\n**Current behavior:**\r\n- DEV mode: Warns when effect returns non-function (mount time) ✅\r\n- Production: No runtime check before calling cleanup → crashes ❌\r\n\r\n**Related Issue:** #35193\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nAdded `typeof destroy === 'function'` checks in two places:\r\n\r\n1. **`commitHookEffectListUnmount`** (line 267): Wraps cleanup execution in type check to prevent unnecessary profiling overhead\r\n2. **`safelyCallDestroy`** (line 917): Defensive check as a safety net\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n- Added runtime type check before calling cleanup functions\r\n- Prevents profiling markers from being set for non-function values\r\n- Silently skips non-function cleanup values (no crashes)\r\n- Fixes the regression where returning `null` from useEffect causes crashes\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- [x] Code follows React's style guidelines\r\n- [x] Changes are minimal and focused\r\n- [ ] Existing tests pass (needs verification)\r\n\r\n## Code References\r\n\r\n- File: `packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberCommitEffects.js`\r\n- Function: `commitHookEffectListUnmount` (lines 248-302)\r\n- Function: `safelyCallDestroy` (lines 914-938)",

Issues without reproduction steps or\n  code examples may be immediately closed as not actionable.\n-->\n\nLink to code example:\nhttps://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/gj356q\n\n<!--\n  Please provide a CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new), a link to a\n  repository on GitHub, or provide a minimal code example that reproduces the\n  problem. You may provide a screenshot of the application if you think it is\n  relevant to your bug report. Here are some tips for providing a minimal\n  example: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve.\n-->\n\n## The current behavior\nIf you click the button and increment the counter you always see `0` in the log. By removing the `memo` you will see the current counter value.\n\n\n## The expected behavior\nSee the latest counter value even if the component is wrapped in `memo`, since the documentation https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffectEvent does not describe any different behavior if component is wrapped in `memo`.\n\n",

This PR fixes a bug where React Compiler was breaking the new JavaScript `using` syntax.\r\n\r\nThe Problem:\r\nWhen you write code like this:\r\n  using resource = new Disposable(\"render\");\r\n\r\nReact Compiler was stripping out the `using` keyword and turning it into:\r\n  new Disposable(\"render\");\r\n\r\nThis completely breaks the disposal mechanism - Symbol.dispose() never gets called and you get resource leaks.\r\n\r\nWhat I Did:\r\nI added a check in BuildHIR.ts (around line 868) that makes the compiler bail out when it sees `using` or `await using` declarations. Now instead of breaking your code, it just skips compiling that component and shows a \"not yet supported\" message.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n- File: compiler/packages/babel-plugin-react-compiler/src/HIR/BuildHIR.ts\r\n- Added detection for `using` and `await using` \r\n- Compiler now bails out instead of incorrectly transforming\r\n\r\nTesting:\r\nI tested this with the example from issue #35171. Now the disposal works correctly and the compiler doesn't mess up the using syntax.\r\n\r\nThis is a temporary fix - in the future we could fully support `using` by properly tracking disposal through the compilation pipeline. But for now, this at least prevents the bug.",

Open App.tsx to see there are three [diposables with `using` syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/using). Open the console, note that only one of the Disposables had its `Symbol.dispose` method called.\n\nTo show that it's react-compiler's fault, you can:\n- observe that only `using` syntax inside the component is transformed, the one at the top level is preserved.\n- uncomment `effect.useIt()` which makes react-compiler skip the component and all the disposals work.\n- skip the component\n- disable the transform in vite.config.ts\n\nNote that react-compiler transforms the `using render = new Disposable(\"render\");` to just `new Disposable(\"render\")`, which is not a valid transform. It would be valid for a `const` or `let` binding.\n\nThere is another bug in here that I can't reproduce, because react-compiler keeps bailing out when I add the `useIt` call. But very similar code to the following *does* get compiled, and in that case the using is just transformed to a const, which again breaks the disposal.\n\n\n```typescript\nfunction App() {\n  const context = useContext();\n  const ref = React.useRef(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (ref.current) {\n      using effect = new Disposable(context);\n      effect.useIt();\n    }\n  });\n\n  return <div ref={ref}></div>;\n}\n```\n\n### How often does this bug happen?\n\nEvery time\n\n### What version of React are you using?\n\n19.2.0\n\n### What version of React Compiler are you using?\n\n1.0.0",

Each form associated element has its own reset algorithm.\r\n\r\nFor `<input>`, that's reading back the `value` attribute which is why syncing the attribute value is critical for reset. \r\n\r\nAccording to the spec, `<select>` reads from the `selected` attribute (https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/form-elements.html#the-select-element) which is reflected from the `defaultSelected` DOM property.
