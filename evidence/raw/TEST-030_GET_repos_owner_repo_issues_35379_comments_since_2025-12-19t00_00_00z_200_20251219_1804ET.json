Anyway, yes, I think the solution would be something like prefixing all function calls on `Symbol` with globalThis (or setting Symbol to a variable like `___Symbol` or something virtually guaranteed to not be shadowed).",

I tried working on it, but I think it's best to rename your function to something other than Symbol.\n\n@mallorysmith64 , Could you point to some documentation stating that Symbol is not being allowed as a file or component name in React? I have not found it to be the case. The whole reason I encountered this problem was that I had a component named `Symbol` in a file named Symbol.tsx. Only after plugging in React Compiler did I encounter a problem, and there was nothing in the console to help me understand what the problem was. Only after some debugging and asking lots of questions to an LLM was I able to figure out the problem. So, I'm pretty convinced this is a rough edge of React Compiler that should be smoothed.\n\nAnyway, I have not delved into the codebase, so maybe I'm missing something, but I don't believe it should be difficult to solve this problem with a prefix or variable, as discussed in my previous comment and @Mudavath-Giri-Naik 's comment.",
