This breaks expected React behavior where controlled inputs should maintain their state.\r\n\r\n**Reproduction:** https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/checkbox-reset-repro-sff3sr\r\n\r\n## The Fix\r\nEnhanced `resetFormInstance()` in `ReactFiberConfigDOM.js` to:\r\n1. Check React's internal fiber tree to determine if an input is controlled\r\n2. Skip reset for inputs controlled by `checked` or `value` props\r\n3. Only reset truly uncontrolled inputs\r\n\r\nThis ensures controlled inputs maintain their state after form submission while uncontrolled inputs still reset as expected.\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\nAdded 3 new test cases in `ReactDOMForm-test.js`:\r\n- Controlled checkboxes don't reset on form submission\r\n- Controlled radio buttons don't reset on form submission  \r\n- Uncontrolled checkboxes still reset correctly\r\n\r\nAll existing tests continue to pass (48/48).\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n- Ran full test suite: `yarn test ReactDOMForm-test`\r\n- Verified reproduction case scenario\r\n- Tested with both controlled and uncontrolled inputs",

The three fields below are mandatory.\r\n\r\n  Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:\r\n\r\n  1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create your branch from `main`.\r\n  2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.\r\n  3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n  4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.\r\n  5. Run `yarn test --prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.\r\n  6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn test --debug --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\r\n  7. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\r\n  8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only check changed files.\r\n  9.

This was incorrect behavior according to the [React documentation](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/form#handle-form-submission-on-the-client) which states:\r\n\r\n> After the action function succeeds, all uncontrolled field elements in the form are reset.\r\n\r\n### Root Cause\r\nIn `startHostTransition` (line ~3270 in `ReactFiberHooks.js`), `requestFormReset(formFiber)` was being called **before** `action(formData)` executed, causing forms to reset regardless of whether the action succeeded or failed.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nWrapped the action call in try/catch so that `requestFormReset` is only called if the action doesn't throw a synchronous error. For async actions, the form reset is scheduled immediately after the action is called (before the promise resolves), which matches the existing behavior for successful async actions.\r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\n\r\n1. **Reproduced the bug** using the CodeSandbox from issue #35295\r\n   - Confirmed forms were incorrectly resetting when actions threw errors\r\n\r\n2. **Verified the fix**\r\n   - All 44 existing tests in `ReactDOMForm-test.js` pass\r\n   - Added new test case: \"forms should not reset when action fails\"\r\n   - New test fails on main branch, passes with this fix\r\n   - Manually tested the CodeSandbox example - forms now correctly preserve data when actions fail\r\n\r\n3. **Ran test commands:**\r\n```bash\r\n   yarn test ReactDOMForm-test\r\n   # Result: 45/45 tests passing\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. **Confirmed no regressions:**\r\n   - Existing tests for successful actions still pass\r\n   - Forms still reset correctly after successful actions\r\n   - Error handling in actions works as expected\r\n",

If I have made a mistake I apologize, but as you can see in that screenshot I could not find `shells/webextension`... I was able to find a top-level `shells` directory in the git history, but I must admit the git history is a little confusing, perhaps because this code [used to live in a separate repo](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools) once upon a time?\r\n\r\nIn any event, it would be great if one of the maintainers could spend a few minutes confirm the issue and give a quick update for people coming to this fresh who want to dive into this particular aspect of the source code.

Since `React` is not an effect hook, the validation was skipped.\r\n\r\nThe fix changes `instr.value.receiver` to `instr.value.property` so that `useEffect` is correctly identified as an effect hook.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n const callee =\r\n   instr.value.kind === 'MethodCall'\r\n-    ? instr.value.receiver\r\n+    ? instr.value.property\r\n     : instr.value.callee;\r\n```\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Added a `React.useEffect` case to `invalid-setState-in-useEffect.js`.\r\n2. Updated `invalid-setState-in-useEffect.expect.md` and checked the Logs: only one `CompileError` at line 7, missing `React.useEffect` at line 10. (See [Commit 1](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/35280/commits/87f9cb5d55430f586d1368a7ae5b4208a9978d95))\r\n3. Fixed `ValidateNoSetStateInEffects.ts`.\r\n4. Updated `invalid-setState-in-useEffect.expect.md` again and checked the Logs: now two `CompileError`s are reported (line 7 and line 10). (See [Commit 2](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/35280/commits/5f4740956be8c9c6a34609e57ffc7136d6c4e769))\r\n5.

Issues without reproduction steps or\n  code examples may be immediately closed as not actionable.\n-->\n\nLink to code example:\nhttps://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/gj356q\n\n<!--\n  Please provide a CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new), a link to a\n  repository on GitHub, or provide a minimal code example that reproduces the\n  problem. You may provide a screenshot of the application if you think it is\n  relevant to your bug report. Here are some tips for providing a minimal\n  example: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve.\n-->\n\n## The current behavior\nIf you click the button and increment the counter you always see `0` in the log. By removing the `memo` you will see the current counter value.\n\n\n## The expected behavior\nSee the latest counter value even if the component is wrapped in `memo`, since the documentation https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffectEvent does not describe any different behavior if component is wrapped in `memo`.\n\n",

Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request. The three fields below are mandatory.\r\n\r\n  Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:\r\n\r\n  1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create your branch from `main`.\r\n  2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.\r\n  3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n  4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.\r\n  5. Run `yarn test --prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.\r\n  6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn test --debug --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\r\n  7. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\r\n  8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only check changed files.\r\n  9. Run the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) type checks (`yarn flow`).\r\n  10. If you haven't already, complete the CLA.\r\n\r\n  Learn more about contributing: https://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Explain the **motivation** for making this change. What existing problem does the pull request solve?\r\n-->\r\n  Fixes #35203\r\n\r\n  The compiler was incorrectly discarding computed property key notation\r\n  when used with method shorthand syntax, transforming `[key]() {}` into\r\n  `key() {}`.\r\n\r\n  Changed the hardcoded `false` parameter to `property.key.kind === 'computed'`\r\n  in CodegenReactiveFunction.ts to preserve computed keys, matching the\r\n  pattern already used for regular object properties.\r\n  \r\n## How did you test this change?\r\n\r\nTDD, adding tests\r\n<!--\r\n  Demonstrate the code is solid. Example: The exact commands you ran and their output, screenshots / videos if the pull request changes the user interface.\r\n  How exactly did you verify that your PR solves the issue you wanted to solve?\r\n  If you leave this empty, your PR will very likely be closed.\r\n-->\r\n",

Problem reported by `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` 💥\n\n<!--\n  Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't\n  have dependencies other than React.

In general, the body of an effect should do one or both of the following:\n* Update external systems with the latest state from React.\n* Subscribe for updates from some external system, calling setState in a callback function when external state changes.\n\nCalling setState synchronously within an effect body causes cascading renders that can hurt performance, and is not recommended.

Here are some tips for providing a minimal\n  example: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve.\n-->\n\n## Widespread setState in `useEffect` Patterns\n\n1. Displaying different content on the server and client aka `didMount`, `isClient`, `isMounted`, `mounted` [React docs 1](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect#displaying-different-content-on-the-server-and-the-client), [React docs 2](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot#handling-different-client-and-server-content), [Next.js docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/react-hydration-error), [next-themes docs](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes#avoid-hydration-mismatch), [MUI Joy UI docs](https://mui.com/joy-ui/customization/dark-mode/)\n2. Setting a value while avoiding cascading renders from @controversial\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/issues/34045\n\nI will add any more common patterns I find to the list as I encounter more examples.\n\nSome examples of other, less widespread patterns:\n\n1. Syncing `URL.createObjectURL()` with state https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/34743#issuecomment-3437002940\n\n## The current behavior\n\n`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` raises a problem with the message `Calling setState synchronously within an effect can trigger cascading renders`\n\n## The expected behavior\n\n`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` is less strict, allowing for common usage patterns while catching possible [\"effect loops\"](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/issues/755#issuecomment-3362222906) or other unwanted behavior\n\n## Alternatives considered\n\n1. Improved examples on [the `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` docs page](https://react.dev/reference/eslint-plugin-react-hooks/lints/set-state-in-effect), showing more patterns such as [the remediation patterns mentioned below](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/34743#issuecomment-3370287621) that can be used in lieu of setting state directly in an effect (possible downside: some patterns may not have usable replacements outside of setting state in effects)\n2. Improved examples on [the `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` docs page](https://react.dev/reference/eslint-plugin-react-hooks/lints/set-state-in-effect), showing alternative patterns with setting state directly in an effect eg. [using `startTransition()`, `requestAnimationFrame()` or `setTimeout()`](https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/pull/8029#discussion_r2394023573) (downside: seems wrong, like a code smell or \"tricking the lint rule\")\n\n## History\n\n- The React Compiler team is aware of problems like this and is thinking about how to better handle false positives https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/34045#issuecomment-3137784707\n\ncc @jedwards1211 @josephsavona ",

Use Mantine's library (maybe other UI libraries has the same problem, no idea)\n2. Use \"Box\" and \"Paper\" components (you can try other ones too)\n3. Navigate between pages and you will get randomly this error\n\nLink to reproduce the problem: https://www.ndnci.com/tools/\n\n## Steps To Reproduce in the demo\n\n1. Go to \"Tools\" listing page\n2. Click on any tool, then in the breadcrumbs, click back on \"Tools\" and repeat the same thing on several tools, I don't know how many click we need to get this but when it happens it is very anoying because the UI is completely broken, we have to reload the page\n\n## The current behavior\n\nHydratation issue brokes the UI during navigation randomly\n\n<img width=\"1858\" height=\"728\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c678333-db3b-450d-bffd-daa39aca070c\" />\n\n## The expected behavior\n\nHydratation issue must be fixed and never break the UI\n\n<img width=\"1549\" height=\"680\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22d864ed-7d2e-47aa-a24e-86a5421206fa\" />\n",
